# Tap-Portal-Frontend

The aim of this project is to develop an online application for training and placement department of our college. The system is an application that can be accessed throughout the college with proper login provided. This system can be used as an application for the Training and the Placement officers (TPO) of the college to manage the student information with regard to placement. Student login should be able to upload their information in the form of CV. The application provides the facility of maintaining the details of the students.

### This Repo is Frontend of [Tap-Portal-Backend](https://github.com/pcon-code-tribe/Tap-Portal-Backend)
## Guidelines

Please try to follow these guidelines:

- [ ] Use only CSS/SCSS or Styled Components for styling the app, DON'T use bootstrap, material UI, semantic UI or any other styling library. (Haha! :wink: No shortcuts here :rofl:)

- [ ] Try to make the UI as elegant as possible, use Cards, box-shadows etc. Choose a subtle color-theme.

- [ ] Prefer functional components over class components, use react hooks.

- [ ] Unless absolutely necessary, don't use Redux for state management, try keeping things simple!

- [ ] Only use images/content that are available for free and don't need any special license.

- [ ] Last but not the least, use your imagination to build the coolest app you can think of ! :heart_eyes_cat: :fire: :fire:
